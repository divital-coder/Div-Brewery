My journey spans medical imaging, computational biology, high-energy physics, and AI alignment‚Äîdiverse domains united by the underlying mathematics of machine learning and scientific computing. </p><p> As an active contributor to the Julia programming community, I work at these intersections, developing tools and frameworks that empower researchers to visualize, analyze, and understand complex data across disciplines. Through high-performance computing techniques, I strive to make these solutions not just powerful but practical for real-world applications. </p><h2 id="research-interests-contributions"> Research Interests &amp; Contributions </h2><h3> üî¨ Medical Imaging &amp; Computational Biology </h3><p> My work at the interface of imaging and computational biology focuses on developing tools for visualizing and analyzing complex biological data: </p><ul><li>Lead developer for <a href="https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedEye3d.jl">MedEye3d.jl</a>, a visualization tool for CT and PET medical imaging data (Google Summer of Code 2024)</li><li>Creator of <a href="https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedImages.jl">MedImages.jl</a>, a package for standardized processing of DICOM and NIFTI medical image formats</li><li>Research in cellular imaging, particularly particle picking and segmentation in Cryo-ET datasets, enabling near-atomic resolution of cellular structures</li><li>Exploring computational models for protein folding and molecular dynamics simulations</li></ul><p><a href="https://juliahealth.org/JuliaHealthBlog/posts/divyansh-gsoc/gsoc-2024-fellows.html">Read more about my GSOC contributions</a></p><h3> ‚öõÔ∏è High-Energy Physics &amp; Simulation </h3><p> I&#39;m passionate about bringing modern machine learning techniques to particle physics: </p><ul><li>Developing <a href="https://github.com/divital-coder/hepmc3-dev.jl">HepMC3.jl</a>, a Julia wrapper for CERN&#39;s HepMC3 C++ library</li><li>Implementing diffusion models for detector simulation</li><li>Creating BinnedDistributionFit.jl and supporting packages for statistical analysis in HEP as part of the Princeton University&#39;s HSF-INDIA collaboration</li></ul><h3> ü§ñ AI Systems &amp; Alignment </h3><p> I explore the frontiers of multi-agent AI systems with a focus on safety and alignment: </p><ul><li>Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador working with Azure AI and ML solutions</li><li>Camel-AI Ambassador contributing to <a href="https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues/1422#issuecomment-2647817131">cookbooks</a> for agent framework implementations</li><li>Research on AI alignment techniques to ensure AI systems behave in accordance with human values and intentions</li><li>Exploring interpretability and explainability methods for complex neural network architectures</li></ul><h3> üíª High-Performance Computing </h3><p> I&#39;m dedicated to making complex scientific computations accessible and efficient: </p><ul><li>Optimizing computational workflows for multi-GPU and distributed computing environments</li><li>Developing parallelization strategies for large-scale simulations in physics and biology</li><li>Leveraging Julia&#39;s multiple dispatch and compile-time optimizations for performance-critical applications</li><li>Implementing CUDA kernels for accelerating machine learning and scientific computing tasks</li></ul><h2> The Digital Alchemy: Transforming Data into Understanding </h2><p> Like the alchemists of old who sought to transmute base metals into gold, today&#39;s scientists and engineers work to transform raw data into profound understanding.
